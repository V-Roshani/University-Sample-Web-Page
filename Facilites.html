        <h1> UNIVERSITY STUDENT FACULITIES AND INTRODUCTION</h1> 
        <p>The concept of establishing the Open University of Sri Lanka was by Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne the Cabinet Minister of Education & Higher Education at the time.</p>

            <p>The University was set up by the Government of Sri Lanka under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, for the purpose of providing higher educational opportunities to working adults â€“ providing them the road to success, surpassing age, vocation, gender, race, ethnicity and religion. The OUSL has the same legal and academic status as any other national university in Sri Lanka.</p>
            
           <p>The university policy on admission would enable a person to register at the lowest 'Level' with mere basic literacy and then climb up to postgraduate level.</p>
            
           <p>The concept of Distance Education at the OUSL functions through a dynamic network of regional and study centres, with knowledge imparted through multiple media. Therefore, students with work commitments are able to pursue studies since they interact with especially designed self-instructional materials where the materials function as a "Tutor in Print". This method provides the distance learner with the best possible learning opportunity to enable a balancing of personal, work related and academic obligations</p>

        <p>The distance learning methodology adopted by the OUSL may initially appear as a challenging task to students. In addition to gaining subject knowledge and skills, students develop many other life skills, including, self-organization, and time management. Regular lectures, a feature of face-to-face teaching at a conventional university, is minimal at the OUSL. Instead, students learn through with other forms of support that facilitate learning.</p>

           <h3>Study package</h3>
            <p>The OUSL adopts a multimedia system for teaching with a strong emphasis on distance learning. </br>The study system supports the students through printed course material, audio visual aids, discussions, day schools, tutor clinics, lab and field works, industry visits, web-based learning, etc. <b>Continuous assessments and final examinations are also integral parts of the study system.</br>
            
            Printed course material is the center element in the study package. Improving reading skills is therefore essential to be successful as an OUSL student</b>. Where applicable, students will also be provided with other supportive material applicable to a course, such as study guides, practical guides, audio visual material, etc. Printed course materials are carefully prepared to suit self study and independent learning. The printed course materials provide the students the subject knowledge of the course.</p> The clearly outline the objectives of the course and what the student will be able to achieve by studying the course. Self-assessment questions and activities included in the course material will enable the learners to continuously assess themselves as they proceed. Printed course materials are normally provided at the time of registration for a programme/course.  </p>

                  <p>Open and Distance Learning</p>
                    <p>What: Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is an approach to teaching and learning that offers open and flexible access to learning opportunities to anyone, anywhere, and at any time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why: ODL is especially useful for potential students who are unable to access learning opportunities where they are provided. For these students, learning opportunities need to be offered where they are located, and provided at a time which best suits them and their circumstances. ODL also offers students choices in relation to entry and exit points, as well as selection of courses, making it particularity suitable for lifelong-long learners who wish to continue with their education while in employment or engaged with domestic work.</p>
                    
                   <p> How: ODL methods use a wide variety of technologies to bridge the divide that is created by the physical separation of learners from the teachers and the educational institution. These include printed as well as digital learning resources, audio and video conferencing, online learning management systems, mobile devices, as well as a growing list of social media tools.</p>
